ApeEscapeRecomp $Version

Ape Escape boots from the PlayStation BIOS and plays into its 3D title and
gameplay. This is an in-development preview; a full playthrough has not been
verified, so expect rough edges.

This package includes the MIT-licensed OpenBIOS from PCSX-Redux and its notice
in bios/OpenBIOS.LICENSE. It does not include the Ape Escape disc, a retail
PlayStation BIOS, save data, or game assets.

First launch:
1. Run ApeEscapeRecomp.exe. A launcher window opens.
2. OpenBIOS is selected automatically. You may optionally select your legally
   obtained SCPH1001.BIN in the BIOS row.
3. Set the game disc: your legally obtained Ape Escape (USA, SCUS-94423) image.
4. Adjust options and choose any features on the Mods page, then press
   Launch. Ape-specific bundled mods include Widescreen, Frame Smoothing, Skip
   FMVs, and Quick Gadget Select. Frame Smoothing is temporal blending, not
   motion-vector frame generation. Quick Gadget Select was contributed by mthsk.

Ape Escape requires an analog (DualShock) controller -- a controller is
strongly recommended. The selected BIOS/disc paths are saved next to the exe.

Disc image formats: .cue + .bin (pick the .cue) or .bin. Do NOT convert to a
2048-byte "cooked" .iso -- it discards the XA sectors used for FMV/audio.

Save states and rewind are available through the launcher hotkeys. Defaults:
F7 opens the save-state menu and F8 rewinds.

Memory cards, save states, and rewind data are stored in the saves directory.
